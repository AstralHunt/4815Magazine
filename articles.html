                      Cosmopolitan's circulation continued to decline for another decade until Helen Gurley Brown became chief editor in 196537 and radically changed the magazine.38 Brown remodeled and re-invented it as a magazine for modern single career women,39 completely transforming the magazine into a racy, contentious, and successful magazine.

                      As the editor for 32 years, Brown spent this time using the magazine as an outlet to erase stigma around unmarried women not only having sex, but also enjoying it.40 Known as a "devout feminist",41 Brown was often attacked by critics due to her progressive views on women and sex. She believed that women were allowed to enjoy sex without shame in all cases.

                      She died in 2012 at the age of 90.40 Her vision is still evident in the design of the magazine.38 The magazine eventually adopted a cover format consisting of a usually young female model (or prominent female celebrity), typically in a low cut dress, bikini, or some other revealing outfit.

                    <h3>Cosmopolitan Today</h3>
                    <p>
                      Since the 1960s, Cosmopolitan has discussed such topics as health, fitness, and fashion, as well as sex. The magazine has also featured a section called "Ask Him Anything", where a male writer answers readers' questions about men and dating.

                      The magazine, in particular its cover stories, has become increasingly sexually explicit in tone. In 2000, the grocery chain Kroger, at the time the second largest in the US after Walmart, began covering up Cosmopolitan at checkout stands because of complaints about sexually inappropriate headlines.[60] The UK edition of Cosmopolitan, which began in 1972, was the first Cosmopolitan magazine to be branched out to another country. It was well known for sexual explicitness, with strong sexual language, male nudity, and coverage of such subjects as rape. In 1999, CosmoGIRL!, a spinoff magazine targeting a teenage female audience, was created for international readership. It shut down in December 2008.
